# The blogging app.
The app is a website that allows users to view blogs, edit blogs and create blogs.
The website is really simple with an interactive ui that is easy to use and understand.

##The home page
The homepage has a list of all the available blogs at the backend of the project. This is displayed in a list with two buttons. One is for viewing a particular blog while another is for deleting the said blog.
The user can scroll through the list and read the blogs as he or she likes. Whe they want to view a said blog. They can click on the view button and they will be redirected to a page where they can view the blog. On that page they will also have the ability to edit the blog.
The user can also decide to delete a blog which will result to deletion from both the backend and front end simultaneously. This is a destructive action and users are meant to use it as sparingly as possible.

##Add blog
The add blog page consists of a form. This form accepts inputs of:
  1. Title.
  2. Content.

The user can add a title and content for a new blog on any topic of choice. Once they are happy with there input they can use the submit button to send their work. An alert will show up to indicate successful posting and now the blog is available for viewing on the homepage. After submission the form is reset and is back to being blank.

##Edit blog
This is the redirection page when the user clicks on edit button on the view page. Once clicked a pop up will appear with the title and content section being editable. They can make changes as pleased and when done they can save it and the changes are applied simultaneously to the frontend and backend. But if the user feels that there is no need to edit the changes they can click the cancel button and it will discard the changes that have been made.
